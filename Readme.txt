DOPOSCCI 3: dopStep
A functional Transcranial Doppler Ultrasound (fTCD) Summary MATLAB Toolbox
where:
dop = Doppler
OSCCI = Oxford Study of Children’s Communication Impairments)

DOPOSCCI is a MATLAB toolbox for handling and summarising fTCD data.

It has been programmed to work with .TX/.TW and .EXP data files acquired with DopplerBox hardware from DWL. But there’s no reason it couldn’t be updated for additional data formats.

It has been written for Mac X and Windows operating systems running MATLAB 2014a or later.
